Data from this analysis is from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/code/iamnimish/alcohol-specific-deaths-analysis
I filtered on deaths related to by excess and alcohol poisoning.
This is data for the UK only and is 2001-2021 (no data on 2020 it seems).

Note - you can select 'very raw' in github to actually see the xls doc.   I believe it removed some of my observations though.
